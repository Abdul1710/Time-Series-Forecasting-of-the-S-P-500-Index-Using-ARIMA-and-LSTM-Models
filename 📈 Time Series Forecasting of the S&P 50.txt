📈 Time Series Forecasting of the S&P 500 Index Using ARIMA and LSTM

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting the S&P 500 stock market index using time series analysis. A traditional statistical model (ARIMA) and a deep learning model (LSTM) are implemented and compared to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting future index values.

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Understanding**
   Load, inspect, and validate time-series data.

2. **Preprocessing**
   Select target variable, scale data, and create time-based train-test split.

3. **Modeling**

   * ARIMA as a baseline statistical model
   * LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependencies

4. **Evaluation**
   Models are evaluated using RMSE and MAE.

5. **Visualization**
   Actual vs predicted values are plotted for comparison.
